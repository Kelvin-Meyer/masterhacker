# masterhacker
## Background
At the subreddit [/r/masterhacker](https://reddit.com/r/masterhacker), there are people asking how to hack.
Mostly they want to hack a social media account to take revenge or something similiar. 
This subreddit makes fun of them by giving them instructions that make no sense at all.
But most users acutally think it's real.

## What's this?
Take a look at my website: [kelvin.click/hacking](http://kelvin.click/hacking)

This is definitely not as good as handwritten instructions,
but with 99,99% failure rate, I cannot complain…
